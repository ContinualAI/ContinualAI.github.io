Humans have the extraordinary ability to learn continually from experience. We not only apply previously acquired knowledge and skills to new situations, but we also build upon these foundations to enhance our learning over time. One of the grand challenges in AI is to develop artificial agents that can mimic this capability—continual learning—by building a deep understanding of the world through the incremental acquisition of increasingly complex knowledge and skills.

**ContinualAI** is an official non-profit research organization and the largest open community dedicated to Continual Learning for AI. Our core mission is to drive continual learning research forward by connecting researchers, sharing ideas, and producing original research on this crucial topic for the future of AI.

### Our Mission
We aim to advance continual learning research through several key initiatives:
- **Organizing and Sponsoring Events:** We host workshops at major AI conferences, organize industrial panels, webinars, and publish special issues focused on continual learning.
- **Building Communication Platforms:** We enhance collaboration through our aggregation and communication platforms, including Slack, social media channels, mailing lists, newsletters, and forums.
- **Supporting Open Source Development:** We have established the **ContinualAI Lab**, a distributed, collaborative team focused on developing open-source projects and tools that simplify continual learning research.
- **Facilitating Global Collaboration:** We have formed **ContinualAI Research**, a research consortium that coordinates and fosters collaboration between continual learning labs worldwide.

At **ContinualAI**, we believe that continual learning is a fundamental pillar for the future of AI, and through our open, inclusive community, we are dedicated to shaping this future together.
